*** Week 6 - pp. 245-253
**** "[By the 1920s,] the motion picture had become a major urban institution for the middle class." (245)
**** "Over the next fifteen years, the number of cinemas grew to over eight hundred, averaging 1,200 seats each, or one for every six people in the entire metropolis." (245)
**** "In twentieth-century America, ... movies and mass culture were key elements in the transition from nineteenth-century values of strict behavior toward greater moral experimentation." (246)
**** "A generation of film scholars have offered two basic reasons. One was that the climate was ideal for film making." (246)
**** "Mediterranean balmy weather made it possible to film outdoors all year round, without the hindrance of snow or rain." (246)
**** "The second argument claims that, to escape Edison's trust, independents moved to the far end of the continent where they could flee quickly into Mexico if confronted..." (246)
**** "Yet only Los Angeles offered the vision of a new West." (247)
**** "More than most industries, the studio also had a personnel turnover which suggested that the "new life" was open to youth and talent." (249)
**** "Morever, three-fourths of the industry's female performers were under twenty-five. This suggests that the youth cult so necessary for uplifting "foreign" elements concentrated most heavily on women, who were responsible for making sensuality innocent..." (250)
**** "Because the consumption allure was the key to the Holloywood image, the star's life took on more than a private importance. In contrast to earlier stage personalities, film idols presented national models as leisure experts." (251)
**** "the movie folk could be universally loved because they were not socially powerful: they were purely a status group. Unlike politicians or manufacturers, they did not hold authority over large groups of employees or constituents." (251)
*** Week 6 - pp. 288-296
**** "Among the 54,000 inhabitants of the Imperial Valley in 1927, 20,000 or one third of the population were Mexicans." (289)
**** "Second, most of the Mexican agricultural workers and strikers were residents of the communities, not migrants. The common misconception that Mexican agricultural workers were migrants profoundly affected official treatment of the Mexican." (289)
**** "Third, Mexicans shared a common identity as workers and as Mexicans." (289)
**** "Fourth, ... Mexican workers' mutual aid socities, mutualists, were the most important community organizations. Mutualiss provided unemployment insurance, medican insurance, funeral care, and legal aid." (289)
**** "Fifth, Mexican labor leadership arose out of the Mexican community and the mutualistas." (289)
**** "Most Mexicans who voted in 1914 voted for the Socialist Party...." (290)
**** "California agriculture had been characterized by massive holdings and concetrated ownership since the days of the Spanish land grants, which had often been passed on intact to Anglo owners." (292)
**** "By the Fall of 1931, the economic decline heralded by the 1929 stock market crash had descended into the Great Depression. . . . Midwestern farmers and laborers out of work joined the migrant force as hundreds of Anglos poured into the California fields, many entering in the Imperial Valley and working their way north." (293)
**** "The growers had succedeeded in maintaining power and in jailing or deporting much of the strike leadership." (296)
*** Week 6 - Brilliant, Introduction
**** "However it stood in uneasy tension with the particularities of the "race problems" it sought to analogize--particularities the legal and legislative process only accentuated.
*** Week 7 - Brilliant, Chapters 1-2, pp. 15-57
**** "Like McWilliams, the CFCU viewed these "race problems"  as sharing much in common with one another--as "not entirely distinct." (16)
**** ""The real problem of the day," Resner wrote Marshall, "is he question of the future employment of Negro workers--in fact, of all workers."" (17)
**** "California lawmakers also harbored grave concerns about postwar employment." (17)
**** "Aircraft and shipbuilding--the industries that provided the lion's share of Californian's wartime employment boom--confronted the bleakest future with at least eighty-five percent of their employees expected to lose their jobs." (17)
**** "Such dire predictions soon began to come to fruition. By the end of 1945, overall civilian employment had droppted to 3.25 million from 3.5 million at its peak in the summer of 1943." (18)
**** "Above all, Japanese Americans returning from wartime exile lacked places to which they could return." (24)
**** "Simply put, Harlan's brand of "color-blind" constitutionalismended where Chinese (and, by subsequent extension, other Asian) ineligibilityto immigrate and naturalize began." (30)
**** "As Harlan's dissent made clear, legalized discrimination in the United States did not simply encompass citizens. Noncitizens, too, or, more precisely, immigrants who were racially ineligible to become citizens through the naturalization process were the targets of a species of discriminatory federal and state laws. (30)
**** "Pearl harbor, however, resuscitated the Alien Land Law." (36)
**** "The overwhelming majority of the fifty-five cases they launched during the war's final two years involved land purchased by Japanese immigrant parents in the name of their American-born children, some of whom were serving in the military." (38)
**** "A majority of Californians, however drew no such conclusions. On November 5th, 1946, they rejected Proposition 15 by a vote of 1,143,780 to 797,067. Though decisive, the defeat carried little significance." (43)
**** "The Alien Land Law, after all, remained on the books, even if it was not in the state constitution." (43)
**** "Three years later, a divided California Supreme Court ruled that there was in fact nothing left." (53)
